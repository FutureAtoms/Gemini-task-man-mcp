Headline Option 1: Supercharge Your Cursor AI Workflow for FREE with the Gemini Task Manager!
Headline Option 2: Stop Paying for AI Task Management? Try Abhilash Chadhar's Open-Source Gemini Task Manager for Cursor!
(Body)
Struggling to keep complex AI-driven coding projects organized in Cursor? Wish there was a powerful task management system like Claude Task Master, but without the mandatory paid API keys?
Excited to share the Gemini Task Manager with MCP, created by Abhilash Chadhar! ðŸŽ‰ 1
This open-source tool brings structure and efficiency to your AI development workflow, integrating seamlessly with Cursor via MCP.
Why is it amazing?
âœ… Free Core Functionality: Unlike alternatives requiring paid Anthropic or Perplexity keys, the core task management (add, list, update, dependencies, subtasks) is completely FREE.
âœ… Seamless Cursor Integration: Use natural language commands directly in the Cursor chat thanks to the built-in MCP server. Guide your AI effectively!
âœ… Structured Workflow: Break down complex PRDs and projects into manageable tasks and subtasks. Keep your AI focused, reduce errors, and maintain context.
âœ… Optional Gemini Power: Leverage the Google Gemini API (requires your own free or paid key) for advanced features like automatic PRD parsing, task expansion, and revision â€“ but only if you need them!
âœ… Developer Focused: Built with features developers need, like CLI access, status tracking, dependency management, and task file generation.
âœ… Open Source: Fork it, contribute, make it your own!
Stop juggling context windows and expensive API calls for basic task tracking. Give your AI the structured guidance it needs to shine.
Huge props to Abhilash Chadhar for building and sharing this fantastic tool with the community!

3. 1-Minute Video Transcript
(0:00-0:05) [Upbeat, techy intro music. Screen shows Cursor IDE interface with code.]
Narrator: Using AI like Cursor to code is amazing, right? But managing big projects, keeping the AI on track... it can get messy. And costly!
(0:05-0:15) [Transition to GitHub repo page for Gemini Task Manager. Highlight the name and creator.]
Narrator: What if you could get structured AI task management, without the mandatory paid API keys? Meet the Gemini Task Manager with MCP, created by Abhilash Chadhar! It's open-source and the core features are FREE.
(0:15-0:30) [Show quick cuts: CLI commands like task-manager init, task-manager add, task-manager list. Then show Cursor chat with commands like /list tasks, /add subtask ... being used.]
Narrator: Manage tasks, subtasks, dependencies, and status effortlessly. Use the powerful CLI, OR integrate it directly into Cursor with the MCP server. Just chat naturally like /add task 'Refactor auth module' or /get next task.
(0:30-0:40) [Visual emphasizing "FREE" and contrasting with icons representing paid APIs (e.g., crossed-out dollar signs on generic API logos).]
Narrator: This gives your AI the structure it needs, reducing errors and context overload. And unlike many alternatives, the essential task tracking doesn't rely on expensive, paid APIs!
(0:40-0:50) [Show a quick visual hinting at AI features - maybe PRD text turning into tasks or a task expanding into subtasks.]
Narrator: Need more power? Optionally connect your own Google Gemini API key to unlock features like parsing PRDs directly into tasks or automatically expanding complex steps into detailed subtasks.
(0:50-1:00) [End screen showing GitHub link clearly. Music swells slightly.]
Narrator: Stop fighting complexity and cost. Bring order to your AI coding workflow today. Check out Abhilash Chadhar's Gemini Task Manager on GitHub â€“ it's free, powerful, and ready to integrate with Cursor! [Link: https://github.com/FutureAtoms/Gemini-task-man-mcp]
